OVERVIEw
 Provides the summary of a hadoop job based on the default hadoop log.

USAGE:
  summary [-v| --verbose] -j | --job  log-file 

DESCRIPTION
	summary provides a succinct or verbose analyis of a hadoop job based on 
	the log file. The output is a CSV file that can be used by other programs 
	for deeper analysis.
	
	summary is not clever at all. If the log file suits it, it delivers
	reasonable results. If the log file is not suitable it could either survive
	or die a horrible death. 

	More work is needed to make summary a more robust character.

	The log file is assumed to be the default hadoop log. It has not been tested
	with other formats.

OPTIONS
	-j, --job 
		Job log file. Mandatory.
	-v, --verbose 
		Provide analysis of both job and task logs.
	-h, --help	
		Provide a succinct and unhelpful message.

PYTHON
	It has been tested with Python 2.7.2+
