Overview
 Provides the summary of a hadoop job based on the default hadoop log.

Usage:
  summary [-v] -j log-file

DESCRIPTION
	summary provides a succinct or verbose analyis of a hadoop job based on 
	the log file.
	
	summary is not clever at all. If the log file suits it, it delivers
	reasonable results. If the log file is not suitable it could either survive
	or die a horrible death. 

	More work is needed to make summary a more robust character.

OPTIONS
	-j, --job 
		Job log file. Mandatory.
	-v, --verbose 
		Provide analysis of both job and task logs.
	-h, --help	
		Provide a succinct and unhelpful message.
	-o, --output output-file
		Write CSV output to output-file.
